Source code for "Mnemonics: Type-safe Bytecode Generation at Run Time"
======================================================================

Directories:
 - bytecode: code of the Mnemoncis library
 - objectformatter: code of the formatting library including a compiler using Mnemonics to 
                    compile format expressions to JVM bytecodes.
 - ExampleProject: an example project for playing around with the library.
                   
How to build
============

To build you need to install the sbt launcher. See http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/wiki/Setup
for instructions. In each of the directories you can call `sbt update && sbt package` to build the module.

How to use the example project
==============================

The directory 'ExampleProject' contains an example project to experiment with Mnemonics. It contains
project files for Eclipse. For editing in Eclipse it is recommended to install the current version of
the Scala Eclipse IDE from http://www.scala-ide.org/ .

Otherwise, you can use sbt to build and run the example.
